# Task1
Project Overview
This repository contains a cleaned and structured version of the Auto Sales dataset, initially sourced for data cleaning and preprocessing practice. The dataset encompasses comprehensive sales-related information, including order details, product specifications, customer locations, financial figures, and order statuses.

All cleaning operations were performed using Microsoft Excel, ensuring the dataset adheres to consistent formatting standards and is optimized for further analysis or visualization tasks.

Data Cleaning Procedures
The following data preparation steps were applied:

Duplicate Removal:
Eliminated all duplicate records to ensure data accuracy and integrity.

Header Standardization:
Renamed column headers using consistent naming conventions (e.g., order_number, product_line) for improved readability and compatibility.

Text Normalization:
Resolved inconsistencies in textual fields such as status, product_line, country, and deal_size by applying standardized casing and formatting.

Date Formatting:
Converted all date values to a uniform dd-mm-yyyy format to ensure consistency across time-based analyses.

Whitespace and Case Cleanup:
Trimmed unnecessary spaces and applied proper or lowercase casing to textual data for consistency.

Phone Number and Postal Code Validation:
Cleaned and reformatted phone numbers and postal codes to maintain structural uniformity.

Missing Data Handling:
Identified and addressed missing values using appropriate strategies such as imputation, removal, or flagging.
